# Odin Project
## Recipes
_This is my first Odin Project._\
\
This project will let me showcase my newly learned HTML skills. I will be creating a recipe page with links to various recipes that have crossed my lips over the years.
Here are the basic HTML skills I will utilize
1. Boilerplate HTML code
2. Lists - both ordered and unordered
3. Links
4. Images
